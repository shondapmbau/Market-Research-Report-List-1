<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gear Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Gear Couplings</li><li>Flex Gear Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gear couplings market is primarily categorized into two types: rigid gear couplings and flexible gear couplings. Rigid gear couplings are designed to transmit torque and accommodate slight misalignments without any movement between the gears, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications. In contrast, flexible gear couplings allow for greater misalignment and movement due to their flexible elements, providing enhanced shock absorption and vibration dampening. These features make flexible gear couplings suitable for dynamic and industrial applications, where alignment may vary.</p></p>
