<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Power Cable for EV and HEV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Not Shielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High Voltage Power Cable market for EVs and HEVs includes **shielded** and **not shielded** types. Shielded cables feature an additional conductive layer to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI), ensuring safer and more reliable power transmission in high-voltage systems. They are ideal for complex EV/HEV architectures. Not shielded cables lack this layer, making them lighter and more cost-effective but less effective in EMI-prone environments. Both types cater to varying EV/HEV design needs, balancing performance, safety, and cost considerations.</p></p>
