<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Waterproofing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Stone Waterproofing Agent market is primarily categorized into solvent-based and water-based types. Solvent-based agents typically contain organic solvents, offering deep penetration and strong adhesion, making them ideal for porous stone surfaces. They often provide superior water resistance but may involve volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, water-based agents use water as a solvent, offering easier application and lower environmental impact. While generally safer and less odorous, they may require more frequent reapplication and might not penetrate as deeply as solvent-based options.</p></p>
