<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Concrete Noise Barrier market consists of two main types: ground-mounted and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed directly onto the ground, effectively reducing noise from roadways or railways by reflecting sound away from sensitive areas. In contrast, structure-mounted noise barriers are affixed to existing structures, such as buildings or bridges, to mitigate noise pollution in urban environments. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing acoustic comfort and promoting healthier living conditions in noise-affected areas.</p></p>
