<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent-free Polyurethane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocomponent</li><li>Bi-component</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solvent-free polyurethane market encompasses two primary types: monocomponent and bi-component systems. Monocomponent polyurethane involves a single component that cures upon exposure to moisture, simplifying application and storage. In contrast, bi-component polyurethane consists of two separate components—resin and hardener—that must be mixed before application, allowing for greater control over curing properties and performance. Both types cater to environmentally conscious industries seeking to eliminate harmful solvents while providing durable, high-performance materials for various applications.</p></p>
