<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biological Safety Cabinets and Clean Benches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Class II Type A</li><li>Class II Type B</li><li>Class III</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) and clean benches are critical for protecting personnel and environments in laboratories. Class II Type A BSCs recirculate air, allowing some variability in airflow; Type B BSCs exhaust air externally, ensuring enhanced safety for volatile substances. Class III BSCs provide maximum containment with a gas-tight design and use glove ports for manipulation, ideal for handling highly infectious agents. Clean benches, primarily for protecting samples rather than personnel, ensure a sterile working environment but lack containment features.</p></p>
